# path: discord_bot/cogs/invites.py

"""
Invite tracker — Discord equivalent of ProBot/MEE6's "who invited this
member" feature. Setup is a Components V2 wizard (see _views_invites.py),
posted automatically some time after the bot joins a server (delayed, not
immediate — see WIZARD_POST_DELAY below) and also re-postable any time via
/invites setup, for when the auto-posted one gets buried or deleted.

There is no gateway event for "invite X was used" — Discord only tells
you a member joined. Attribution works by diffing:

  1. Every active invite's use-count is cached (discord_invite_cache),
     rebuilt wholesale on bot startup (on_ready, covers the restart
     case) and on guild join, then kept current on every member join.
  2. On a new join, guild.invites() is re-fetched and compared against
     the cache: whichever invite's `uses` went up by 1 is the one used.
  3. A single-use invite is DELETED by Discord the instant it's used
     (it never shows up with uses+1) — handled as its own case: if
     nothing matched by use-count but exactly one invite disappeared
     from the fetch, that's the one.
  4. The guild's vanity invite (if it has one) isn't included in
     guild.invites() at all, so it's checked separately via
     guild.vanity_invite().
  5. If none of the above resolves — missing Manage Server permission,
     a Discord Discovery join, or a genuinely ambiguous case — the join
     is logged with no inviter rather than guessed at, and the
     announcement (if enabled) says so plainly instead of pretending.

Leaves are tracked too (on_member_remove closes the join row) so the
leaderboard's "net" count isn't inflated by someone using alt accounts
to join-then-leave for a fake invite count.
